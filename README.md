# FileSizeFinder
 -Finds files in a directory and sorts them by size.
 <br> -Originally created so I could find the biggest games in a folder. Specifically Steam. I then used that info for saving disk space.
 <br> -This version doesn't support switch statments and I'm too lazy to figure out a workaround, so this only lists out in GB.
